# Simple Interest Calculator

This program calculates simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Description

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

`Simple Interest = P * T * R`

Where:

*   P = Principal amount
*   T = Time period in years
*   R = Annual rate of interest

## Input

The program takes three inputs:

*   `p`: The principal amount (a numerical value).
*   `t`: The time period in years (a numerical value).
*   `r`: The annual rate of interest (a numerical value, expressed as a decimal or percentage).

## Output

The program outputs the calculated simple interest (a numerical value).

## How to Use

1.  **Provide Input:**  You will need to provide the values for `p`, `t`, and `r`.  The specific method of providing input (e.g., command line arguments, user prompts, reading from a file) will depend on the implementation of the calculator.

2.  **Run the Calculator:** Execute the program.

3.  **View Output:** The calculated simple interest will be displayed as the output.

## Example

Let's say:

*   Principal (p) = 1000
*   Time (t) = 5 years
*   Rate (r) = 10% (or 0.10 as a decimal)

The simple interest would be calculated as:

`Simple Interest = 1000 * 5 * 0.10 = 500`

The program would then output `500`.
